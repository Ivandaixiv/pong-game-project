# Pong Guide

## Setup

1. Download and follow the steps in the readme to setup the [Pong Starter](https://github.com/redacademy/pong-starter)
2. Download and install: [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), this will be used to checkout commits if stuck or need solution code
3. Open the included repo for the "Pong Guide" this you can use with GitKraken to checkout commits for each step, try to only do this if you are stuck and use this repo mainly as a reference while working on your project which is based on the "Pong Starter"
4. Once you get to the end of the slides, try adding some "Stretch Goals" e.g. declaring a winner, shrinking paddles on collision etc... See my demo for some ideas: [pong-starwars](https://resonantdoghouse.github.io/pong-starwars/). For more inspiration you can also try adding some "Hack Physics", see this resource for more info: https://codepen.io/rachsmith/post/hack-physics-and-javascript-1
